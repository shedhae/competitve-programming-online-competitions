# Competitive programming contests website


## **Project Overview**

We are building a Codeforces-like platform to host competitive programming competitions at our university. The platform will include:

- A **home page** with active competitions and recent problems.
- A **problem set** where users can view and solve problems.
- A **competition system** to host real-time programming contests.
- A **submission system** to evaluate user code and provide results.

## Functional Requirements

This database will support:

* CRUD operations for users , competitions, participants, problems and submissions.
* Tracking all versions of participant submissions, including multiple submissions for the same problem.
* The problem details like test cases, topics and to which cometition associated.
* Adding multiple clarifications from a user to the competition creator .
* Adding multiple announcements to participants from the competition creator.

## Representation

Entities are captured in SQLite tables with the following schema.

### Entities

The database includes the following entities:

#### Users

The `users` table includes:

* `id`, which specifies the unique ID for the user as an `INTEGER`. This column thus has the `FOREIGN KEY` references to `participants` table constraint applied.
* `mail`, which specifies the user's email as `TEXT`,and `UNIQUE`.
 This column thus has the `NOT NULL` constraint applied.
* `name`, the user name as as `TEXT`,`NOT NULL`,and `UNIQUE`.
* `password`, which specifies the user's password,given `TEXT` is appropriate for name fields . This column thus has the `NOT NULL` constraint applied.
* `rating`, which specifies when the participant's rating. type of `INTEGER` and `DEFAULT 0` AS a default value.
*
#### participants

The `participants` table includes:

* `id`, which specifies the unique ID for the user as an `INTEGER`. This column thus has the `FOREIGN KEY` references to `participants` table constraint applied.
* `name`, the participant name as as `TEXT`,`NOT NULL`,and `UNIQUE`.
* `users`, which specifies the number of users within this participant as `INTEGER`. This column has the `CHECK users IN (2,3)` , `DEFAULT 2`.
(participant becomes team if the number of users is more than one )


#### User_participants

* `name`, which is the name of the problem set as `TEXT`.This column thus has the `UNIQUE` and `NOT NULL` constraint applied.
* `time_limit` , Time limit in milliseconds per test data set (i.e. per single run). Should be a `NUMERIC`  and `NOT NULL`.
* `memory_limit` , Memory limit in megabytes (MB) per test dataset (i.e., per single run). Should be a `NUMERIC` multiple of 1
* `content` , the content of the problem as `TEXT` ant `NOT NULL`.
* `rating` , the content of the problem as `NUMERIC`.

#### Test_cases

The `test_cases` table includes:

* `id`, which specifies the unique ID for the test_case as an `INTEGER`. This column thus has the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint applied.
* `problem_id`, which is the ID of the problem which the test case associated to as an `INTEGER`. This column thus has the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint applied, referencing the `id` column in the `problems` table to ensure data integrity.
* `input`, which the input of the test as `TEXT`,`NOT NULL`.
* `output`, the expected output of the test as `TEXT`,`NOT NULL`.
* `explanation` ,expanation of the test if it is necessary as `TEXT`.
* `hidden`, which Specifies whether this test case is displayed (0) with the problem content or hidden (1) `CHECK IN(0,1)` ,`NOT NULL` and `DEFAULT 1`
#### Topics

The `topics` table includes:

* `id`, which specifies the unique ID for the topic as an `INTEGER`. This column thus has the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint applied.
* `name`, the name of the topic as `TEXT`, `NOT NULL`.

#### Problems_Topics

The `problems_topics` table includes:

* `problem_id`,  which specifies the unique ID for the problem as an `INTEGER`. This column thus has the `FOREIGN KEY` that references the `problems` table constraint applied.
* `topic_id`, which specifies the unique ID for the topic as an `INTEGER`. This column thus has the `FOREIGN KEY` that references the `topics` table constraint applied.

#### Submissions

The `submissions` table includes:

* `id`, which specifies the unique ID for the submission as an `INTEGER`. This column thus has the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint applied.

* `code` , the solution of the problem as `TEXT`, `NOT NULL`.

#### Clarifications

The `clarifications` table includes:

* `id`, which specifies the unique ID for the clarification as an `INTEGER`. This column thus has the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint applied.
* `participant_id`, which specifies the ID of the participant who asked for the clarification as an `INTEGER`. This column thus has the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint applied, referencing the `id` column in the `participants` table, which ensures that each clarification be referenced back to a participant.
* `problem_id`, which specifies the ID of the problem for which clarification has been requeste as an `INTEGER`. This column thus has the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint applied, referencing the `id` column in the `problems` table, which ensures that each clarification be referenced back to a problem.
* `content`,the clarification content as `TEXT`, `NOT NULL`.

#### Anouncements

* `id`, which specifies the unique ID for the announcement as an `INTEGER`. This column thus has the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint applied.
* `competition_id`, which specifies the ID of the competition to clarify one or many points in one or more problems or submissions as an `INTEGER`. This column thus has the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint applied, referencing the `id` column in the `competitions` table, which ensures that each announcement be referenced back to a competition.
* `content`,the announcement content as `TEXT`, `NOT NULL` written by the competition creator.


### Relationships

The below entity relationship diagram describes the relationships among the entities in the database.

![ER Diagram](EntityDiagram.jpg)

As detailed by the diagram:

* One participant(user or team) is  capable of making 0 to many submissions. 0, if they have yet to submit any work, and many if they submit to more than one problem (or make more than one submission to any one problem). A submission is made by one and only one participant.
* A submission is associated with one and only one problem. At the same time, a problem can have 0 to many submissions: 0 if no participant has yet submitted work to that problem, and many if more than one participant has submitted work for that problem.
* A participant contains one to many users and users belong to at least one participant.
* A competition created by one user, contains many problems, many participants can participate and there are 0 to many announcements related to it.
* A participant has score in particular competition and can particate in many competitions.
* A problem belongs to one competition.
* A clarification is asked by one participant associated to one problem.A participant can ask of many clarifications for many problems.
* A problem has one to many test cases, A test case associated to one problem .
* A problem can be associated to many topics and a topic can be associated to many problems.
